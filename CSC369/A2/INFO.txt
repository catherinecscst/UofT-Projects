Discussion

We think starvation can happen while arriving in the lane or corssing the intersection.

Not every car car enter the lane because the size of the buffer is limited. 
Therefore, no car can into the buffer if it is already full.  
In that case, producer_cv is called to wait in car_arrive.
Until any space is becoming available again, the producer_cv will be signaled to allow cars entering the lane.
Starvation can happen if producer_cv is called to wait forever and never be signaled.

If there is no car in the lane waiting to corss the intersection, consumer_cv will be called to wait.
Until the buffer is not empty again and there is at least one car in the lane waiting to cross, the consumer_sv will be signaled again. 
Starvation can happen when there is no car in the lane AND there is no car is waiting to be added to the buffer.
In this case, consumer_cv will be waited forever can corssing step will never be reached.
