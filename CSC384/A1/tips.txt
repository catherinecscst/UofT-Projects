1.Read the documentation of each functions carefully including the class snowman and search file. 
  Understand the properties of each function and attributes so that we can use in our coding. That could improve the structure as well as consistency of the conding style.

2.If a snowball is in a corner where it is not the destination, then there is a deadlock.
  If two adjacent sides of a snowball is a wall or a obstacle, then there is a deadlock.
  Carefully observe as much as deadlock situation in order to help on limiting the search space.

3.The snowballs can be stakced temporarily while moving and push off later on. Bigger one at the bottom and smaller one on the top.
  However a bigger snowball can not pass through a smaller snowball. Need to consider this situation while coding heur_alternate.

4.We need to understand that searching and locating snowball priority is depending on the size od the snowball. 
  Normally, find the bigger one and and place it first. Unless the case that move the smaller ones some steps can speed up the process or give a better solution.

5.Try not not repeat same computaion steps over and over to save time. Divide up cases wisely.
