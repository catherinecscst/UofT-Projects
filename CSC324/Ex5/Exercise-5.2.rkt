; ★ Fill in the rest of the table of closures.
; A closure is represented by a list with the symbol 'closure:, a λ term, and an environment.
; An environment contains variables and their values, from local to global. The values in an
;  environment are "references" to closures.
; Ignore the part of the top-level environment containing the variable ‘closures’.
